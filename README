An exercise in comparing test tools exercising Java code.

Unit Test Codebase
==================
src directory contains a contrived model with imaginary services to facilitate writing useful tests.

test directory compares the following test and specification centric tools:
* JUnit
* JDave
* RSpec (via JRuby)
* ScalaTest

Mock tools compared and demonstrated:
* Mockito
* EasyMock
* Powermock

Other tools used:
* Checkstyle

Build via: mvn test

Acceptance Test Codebase
========================
Contains a Play! application using the contrived model in the unit test codebase via Play!'s Maven plugin.
The Play! application must currently be started / stopped manually.

Also contains cuke4duke features exercising the Play! application and a demonstration of a fairly complex feature.
Scala, Selenium 2 and ScalaTest are used to fulfill the step definitions.

Start Play! via: play run --%prod
Build via: mvn integration-test
