A comparison of test and specification frameworks using polyglot programming to verify java source.

Unit Test Codebase
==================
src directory contains a contrived model with imaginary services to facilitate writing useful specifications.

test directory exercises the following test and specification frameworks:
* JUnit (in Java)
* JDave (in Java)
* RSpec (in Ruby via JRuby)
* ScalaTest (in Scala)

Mock tools exercised:
* Mockito (both Java and Scala)
* EasyMock (both Java and Scala)
* Powermock (in Java)

Other tools used:
* Checkstyle

Build via: mvn test

Acceptance Test Codebase
========================
Contains a Play! application using the contrived model in the unit test codebase via Play!'s Maven plugin.
The Play! application must currently be started / stopped manually.

Also contains cuke4duke features exercising the Play! application and a demonstration of a fairly complex feature.
Scala, Selenium 2 and ScalaTest are used to fulfill the step definitions.

Start Play! via: play run --%prod
Build via: mvn integration-test
